# DriverPass-Portfolio-Submission---CS-255
Project Summary
The DriverPass project involved designing a comprehensive system to help students better prepare for their driving tests. Our client, DriverPass, observed that over 65% of students fail their driving tests due to ineffective preparation. They wanted us to create a system that combines online practice exams with on-the-road driving lessons, helping users improve their skills and confidence. Our goal was to build a platform that provides lesson scheduling, performance tracking, and integration with DMV policies.

What I Did Well
I feel that I did particularly well in identifying and clearly defining the functional and nonfunctional requirements in the business requirements document. I also created detailed UML diagrams in the system design document that effectively conveyed the structure and behavior of the system.

What I Would Revise
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would improve the use case diagrams by making sure all actors and use cases are labeled more precisely and consistently. I would also take extra time to review the formatting and labeling in Lucidchart to ensure everything is clear and professional.

Interpreting User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully analyzing the project scenario and identifying the key pain points DriverPass wanted to solve. From there, I outlined features like practice tests, scheduling lessons, and syncing with DMV policies. Considering user needs is essential because it ensures the system is both useful and usable. Designing without the user in mind risks creating a system that doesn’t meet real-world expectations.

My Approach to System Design
I approach system design by first breaking the problem into smaller, manageable parts and then identifying the stakeholders, their interactions, and the system’s required functionality. I relied on diagrams like use case, sequence, and activity diagrams to visualize and refine my thinking. In the future, I’d like to strengthen my skills in user-centered design and possibly include user personas and user stories earlier in the process.
