# DriverPass-Portfolio-Submission---CS-255
### 1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was developed for a client named DriverPass, an organization focused on helping students prepare for and pass their driver’s license exams. They identified that over 65% of students fail their exams due to poor preparation. DriverPass wanted a comprehensive online system that would allow students to schedule driving lessons, take practice exams, track their progress, and receive DMV-compliant instruction packages. The system was required to support different user roles like students, secretaries, IT officers, and admins.

### 2. What did you do particularly well?

I did a strong job outlining both the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the system. I also created UML diagrams that clearly represent how different system components interact, ensuring the client’s needs were accurately modeled.

### 3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise anything, it would be the formatting and clarity of the UML diagrams, particularly the use case diagram. I would spend more time refining actor labels, improving layout consistency, and ensuring the visual flow matches the system’s actual logic more precisely.

### 4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I analyzed the case study to determine user pain points and then translated those into functional requirements and system features. For example, students needed scheduling tools and test feedback, while secretaries needed to manage bookings. Considering user needs is critical because the system must actually solve the problems the client is experiencing — otherwise, it fails its purpose.

### 5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I start by gathering all stakeholder requirements, then use diagrams and models to plan out how components should interact. In the future, I’ll continue using UML diagrams, but I’ll also consider using user personas, mockups, and wireframes earlier in the process to better capture user experience and design logic.
